# leaflet-challenge

The earthquake data is fetched from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) GeoJSON and 
is diplayed on OpenStreetMap base layer.

we displayed earthquake markers on a map based on their magnitude and depth.
The color of the marker represents the earthquake depth, dark pink is for more depth snd light green is for less depth. 

we used Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
